@WORKFLOW:
PLANNING THE DAY
- start the pomodoro
- create a new file for today's planning (say 20.txt)
- get an estimate of the total number of pomodoro avilable for current session
- goto previous day planning file (for example 19.txt)
- read pomospective
- read raw pomodoro dump
- look at what was left not done and copy it to the planned section
- goto inventory master file
- look at @inbox at the bottom and process what's there with related tags
- decide what are the main areas of work of today (usually there is a single project taking at least 80% of the time) looking at the "@" sections
- plan and organizes task for those activities

END OF THE POMODORO
- goto today plan, mark one pomodoro current task
- if task done, move to done column
