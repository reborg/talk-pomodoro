POMODORO BASICS IN BRIEF:
- 25 min blah blah

CORE MESSAGES:
- A Pomodoro measures quality work
- The pomodoro micro-cosmos: a reduced scale real-life project in a 30 mins box. Talk about the initial planning, how to deal with yack shaving problems, interruptions and how all of these learned facts reflect in the large scale of the project. Dealing with project complexity on a very small scale with simple rules.
- A consistent use of breaks. Pomodoro defines what to do between breaks.

PRACTICES:
- Pomo-planning: beginning of the day, pomodoro effort available (yesterday's pomodoro - today's allocated for other)
- Pomo-cycle: micro-planning, execution, write down description
- Tagging: attach relevant tags to pomodescription. User story tags, other common tags such as planning, meeting, refactoring, name of developers.
- Pomo-spective
- Day Dreaming break: deep relax technique for 5 minutes break, my blog reference.

ADOPTION TRICKS:
- Start by observing 25 mins of work. How long it was? Observe the break. How to you feel?
- Count pomodoros. How many today? Write on paper
- Mark interruptions.
- Do not impose breaks to your pair if he/she doesn't like it. Give the example, observe the break, ask what happens in the last 5'

TOOLING:
- paper based tooling
- online files

FAQ:
- Q. Isn't the pomodoro process too heavy? For instance, writing the description and tags. A. It's heavier than not-writing but a descriptive sentence for the current pomodoro is plain easy for a time slot of 30' while it's much more difficult for 2 hours of work. Plus it renders plain easy remembering things, leassons learned, standup sessions and in general the activity of "billing hours to higher management".

METRICS:
- average count by day: act if too low or too high
- count by tag: see where most of the time was spent, chart example
- count by developer/week or iteration with prize base
- average developer/week (or iteration) plus standard deviation game: high count + low deviation wins

XP-POMODORO INTEGRATION:
- One pomodoro per pair (no single pomodoro team)
- The coach negotiating to shield the team from interruptions
- Pomodoro based standup: integrate XP stand-up by reading yesterday's pomodump
- Pomodoro ping-pong: 1 pomodoro DevA writes specs, DevB writes code. Following pomodoro the other way around
- Estimate user stories in ideal-days and tasks in pomodoros (pairing sessions VS pomodoro sessions)
- Collective break: decide a target time. Then account for a 15 mins for everyone to close the current pomo.
- Pomo-break. Separated room/kitchen to allow breaks without disturbing. Couch for day dreaming.
- Sustainable pace: weeks table with degrading quality for classic environment

POMODORO SMELLS:
- I feel tired at the end of the day or the week. If that happens you're doing it wrong.
